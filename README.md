## The landscape of gain and loss of function mutations in melanoma
This repository contains the code used to perform analyses and create figures as described in the manuscript. The code is structured as follows:
- omics_models:
- pathway_analysis: Contains scripts used to calculate pathway scores for each omics type (whole-exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, RPPA), assemble correlation matrices for each phenotype of interest, and plot the results as corrplots. Also included are supplemental analyses to calculate odds ratios among gain-of-function, loss-of-function, germline, and somatic variants, run Fisher exact tests for enrichment of genes from these lists in an assembled pathway database, and plot these results.
