## The landscape of gain and loss of function mutations in melanoma
This repository contains the code used to perform analyses and create figures as described in the manuscript. The code is structured as follows:

**omics_models**

Contains scripts used for employing AlphaMissense to classify GOF/LOF variants by structural context. 

**pathway_analysis**

Contains scripts used to calculate pathway scores for each omics type (whole-exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, RPPA), assemble correlation matrices for each phenotype of interest and treatment type, and plot the results as corrplots.

**variant_classification**

Contains scripts for generating omics specific factor loadings, annotating variants with GOF/LOF label, classification, and downstream analyses/visualizations.
